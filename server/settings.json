      "description":" The International Space Station is a large spacecraft. It orbits around Earth. It is a home where astronauts live.  The space station is also a science lab. Many countries worked together to build it. They also work together to use it.  The space station is made of many pieces. The pieces were put together in space by astronauts. The space station's orbit is about 220 miles above Earth. NASA uses the station to learn about living and working in space. These lessons will help NASA explore space. Source: NASA. "

      "description":" NASA's Hubble Space Telescope was launched April 24, 1990, on the space shuttle Discovery from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  Hubble has made more than 1.3 million observations since its mission began in 1990.  Astronomers using Hubble data have published more than 15,000 scientific papers, making it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built.  Hubble does not travel to stars, planets or galaxies. It takes pictures of them as it whirls around Earth at about 17,000 mph.  Hubble has traveled more than 4 billion miles along a circular low Earth orbit currently about 340 miles in altitude.  Hubble has no thrusters. To change pointing angles, it uses Newtonâ€™s third law by spinning its wheels in the opposite direction. It turns at about the speed of a minute hand on a clock, taking 15 minutes to turn 90 degrees. Source: NASA "

It was launched on 13 May 1998, and is currently operational, in a sun-synchronous orbit, 807 km above the Earth, orbiting every 101 minutes. It hosts the AMSU-A and AMSU-B instruments, the AVHRR and High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/3) instruments, as well as a Space Environment Monitor (SEM/2). Source: Wikipedia "
